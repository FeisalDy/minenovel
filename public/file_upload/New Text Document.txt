If you are deploying your application across multiple servers and running migrations as part of your deployment process, 
you likely do not want two servers attempting to migrate the database at the same time. To avoid this, 
you may use the isolated option when invoking the migrate command.

When the isolated option is provided, 
Laravel will acquire an atomic lock using your application's cache driver before attempting to run your migrations. 
All other attempts to run the migrate command while that lock is held will not execute; however, 
the command will still exit with a successful exit status code:If you are deploying your application across multiple servers and running migrations as part of your deployment process,
